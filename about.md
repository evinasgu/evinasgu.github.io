<p>I’m a software developer from Caracas, Venezuela. I’m passionate about using best practices and solving interesting problems.</p>

<p>I’m writing this blog because I want to share my knowledge and help people in this fascinating world of computer programming. I love functional programming, so this blog will have a lot of content about programming languages as Clojure, Erlang, Elixir, Scala, etc. I’m planning to add some content about other topics related with general software development and best practices too, I think my experience will be my main resource to generate content for this blog.</p>

<p>I’m still learning everyday, so I really would appreciate some feedback about my posts.</p>
